# Description

Test detection of DoS attack that tries to increase decoding effort.

# PCAP

Pcap from https://redmine.cs.uni-potsdam.de/projects/pcap/files

# Notes

It might be better to have a dedicated rule that focuses on the DoS aspect, ie that is many fragments with different identifications between the same pair of ipv6 addresses
