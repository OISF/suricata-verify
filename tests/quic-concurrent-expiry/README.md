# quic-concurrent-expiry

An idle incomplete context expires while a recently active context retains its CRYPTO prefix.

All packets use the same UDP five-tuple. These deterministic synthetic captures contain valid encrypted Initial packets and exercise passive Hello extraction, not a complete TLS session.

Regenerate with `python3 util/gen-quic-connections.py` (requires cryptography).
