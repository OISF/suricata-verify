            # invalid for further processing or describe unexpected
            # behavior on an established stream. Networks which
            # experience high occurrences of anomalies may experience
            # packet processing degradation.
            #
            # Anomalies are reported for the following:
            # 1. Decode: Values and conditions that are detected while
            # decoding individual packets. This includes invalid or
            # unexpected values for low-level protocol lengths as well
            # as stream related events (TCP 3-way handshake issues,
            # unexpected sequence number, etc).
            # 2. Stream: This includes stream related events (TCP
            # 3-way handshake issues, unexpected sequence number,
            # etc).
            # 3. Application layer: These denote application layer
            # specific conditions that are unexpected, invalid or are
            # unexpected given the application monitoring state.
            #
