The goal of this test is to do a QA check of the flow-direction feature (see https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/2644).

The feature adds a direction to each flow, enabling to easily determine/filter/graph flows coming from the client or the server on relevant protocols.

The PCAP was locally generated (wget of the Suricata PNG logo on a local server).
